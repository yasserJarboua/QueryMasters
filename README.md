## 🎯 Main Goal
Design an ER model to help MNHS manage patients, staff, hospitals, departments, appointments, prescriptions, medications, insurance, billing, emergencies, and pharmacy inventory.

## 📖 Requirements (Summary)
- Patients with personal details and multiple contact addresses.  
- Staff grouped into practitioners, caregivers, and technical staff.  
- Departments linked to hospitals.  
- Appointments connect patient, staff, and department.  
- Prescriptions include medications with dosage and duration.  
- Patients may have multiple insurances; bills link to one insurance.  
- Emergencies and pharmacy stock tracked per hospital.

## 🏗️ Methodology (Summary)
1. Identified main entities and attributes.  
2. Modeled relationships (binary/ternary) with constraints.  
3. Applied ISA hierarchy (for staff) and weak entities (for emergencies).  
4. Built the ER diagram and validated against requirements.
